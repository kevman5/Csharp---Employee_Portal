# Csharp---Employee_Portal
This C# program was an example of an Employee Portal allowing someone to clock in or out, check their benefits, sick time, vacation, hours worked, etc with the option to save a copy of their information, lots of room for more options if ever needed like saving the clocked hours and adding them up to get your total hours worked, adjusting the way the hours are showed to you, adding a table, etc. Too many options to list. I wasnt exactly sure what my plan was with this project when I started it but I do feel like I got the basics covered of the idea I had. Possibly add on to this at a later time.
